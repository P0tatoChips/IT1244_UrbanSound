##### IT1244 Urban Sound Classification Project

This README provides instructions on how to run the project file for the IT1244 Urban Sound audio classification final project. This project aims to classify audio files into 10 different categories using machine learning techniques, with the dataset already separated into Testing and Training folders. Categories are randomly distributed.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries specified in the dependency setup of the notebook, also specified in 'requirements.txt'

## Installation and Running
1. Clone the repository into your local machine, which has the correct version of Python downloaded
    --> git clone https://github.com/jasonmatthewsuhari/IT1244_UrbanSound.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
    --> cd IT1244_UrbanSound

3. Download all the dependencies (optional, but this will be done anyways in the notebook).
Ensure that the dependencies listed in requirements.txt do not interfere with / are not interfered by any other libraries.
    --> pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the notebook through your desired medium. You can do this through Visual Studio Code, JupyterLab, or by launching it:
    --> jupyter notebook

5. Once the notebook interface opens in your default web browser, navigate to 'Urban Sound Analysis.ipynb'.

6. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook, mostly just running all the codeblocks.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors while running the notebook, check that all dependencies are correctly installed under the right Python version. If the problem persists, refer to the documentation of the errors provided online or contact any of the group members.
